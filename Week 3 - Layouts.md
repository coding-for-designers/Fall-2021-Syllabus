# Food for Thought
How can we shift our mindsets to design a system of constraints rather than absolutes?

# Theory
CSS grids are powerful! Responsive design is algorithmic!

- CSS emulates print design
	- history of multicolumn layouts
- CSS for print
- CSS for screen
- multiple stylesheets
- font embeds
	- FOUT - Flash of Unstyled Text
- advanced css selectors like `+` and `>` and `:only-child` and `nth of type`
- Link `:hover` vs `:focus`
- `float` for text wrap
- E-publishing as subverting capitalism
	- Downloading is subversive
	- Website as free information distribution
	- Cost of creating a website vs. print publication
	- Creative print layouts on the screen, in the browser
- `vw` and `section`

# Workshop

Apply a simpler version of the [Grid Sidebar Layout](Tutorials/Grid%20Sidebar%20Layout.md).

1. Create HTML document with two `<section>` tags, empty, side by side.
2. Set CSS body background to black and section `background-color` to white.
3. Set CSS section height to something like `20em`, adjust in Inspector
4. Set CSS body to `display:grid` with `grid-template-columns: 30% 1fr;`. Adjust `30%` to your liking.
5. Add `border-radius: 7em` and adjust to your liking. Add `grid-gap: 1.3em;` and adjust.
6. Resize browser. Cool!

### Responsive Rectangles

You must decide what width to "break" this layout. Use a [Breakpoint](Tutorials/Breakpoints.md) to collapse the rectangles for smaller screens. Publish on your Github site.

1. Using Inspector with Rulers turned on, resize page to find your ideal breakpoint width in pixels
2. Add media query for `@media (max-width: 775px)`, or whatever measurement you took in Inspector
3. Inside media query, style body with `grid-template-columns: 1fr;`. This creates a single column layout.
4. Resize browser. Wow! ðŸ‘€

## Print to screen
Using columns, grid, and `<section>`, `<aside>`, recreate a printed editorial or book layout as a website.

Remember to use units `%`, `em`, and `vw`
