# Week 1 - Hypertext
HTML Foundations. Introduction to the web browser and code editor as design tools.

Skip to [Homework](#Homework)

# Food for Thought
If your final project is a garden, how do you want people to walk through it? What is the path? Any detours?

When styles are removed, what is the web's default design? How can we communicate visual hierarchy with pure HTML?

What is the importance of writing alt text as poetry?

>Whether your project is a piece of land or a website, your first step should be to create a **solid foundation**. After that, you can gradually cultivate it enabling everything to grow and flourish.

>Every permaculture design starts with a vision that guides you where to go. It is a bit like a distant city you would like to travel to... With every step you take you can observe and adjust your course... it results in an organically evolving process that makes you land exactly where you need to be.

>The metaphor is gorgeous: gardens are places that are tended to and grow out in the open, little by little... A garden can create ‘finished products’ but not immediately, and not without showing the in-between steps first. You can garden alone, or other people can visit, but the garden is all yours to design, build, plant, and maintain.

>“the Web gets its value not from the smoothness of its overall operation but from its abundance of small nuggets that point to more small nuggets. And, most important, the Web is binding not just pages but us human beings in new ways. We are the true "small pieces" of the Web, and we are loosely joining ourselves in ways that we're still inventing.”

>“I think we are drawn to the aesthetics of the early web because it feels authentic and human, like a chair made by hand or a band playing only for the love of it.”

>"There were no big walled gardens, no Twitter or Facebook. If you had anything to say to anyone, you had to put together your own website. It was _amazing_."

>“What you're saying between those angle brackets, that's the anchor,” explains Nicole—it’s what the “a” in “a href” is short for.  Like links on the Web, anchor links made across Intermedia’s five applications could be precise to the word or pixel.”

>"Alt-text has existed since the 1990s, but it is often overlooked altogether or understood solely through the lens of compliance. The resulting alt-text is often written in a reluctant, perfunctory style, but it has tremendous expressive potential."

# Workshop
## A Web without CSS
[HTML without CSS](Tutorials/HTML%20without%20CSS.md)

- Open a website in your web browser
- Disable CSS and Javascript
- Browse through the web with HTML only for 5 minutes
	- Think about how you would design a page with only HTML
- Discussion: what did you find? What websites held up as HTML only pages? What ways do designers demonstrate a visual hierarchy with pure HTML?

## Hello World
Create local directory for website. Workflow covered in [Local Environment](Tutorials/Local%20Environment.md).
Placeholder for now, doesn't have to be perfect!
- Create index.htm
	- Open Atom
	- Type page structure
	- `<h1>Hello World</h1>`
- Open index.htm in local browser
- Index for your assignments throughout course
	- ex. - `<p>This is Megumi Tanaka's project site, started in April 2021 for Coding for Designers.</p>`
	- `<h2>Elsewhere on the web</h2><ul><li><a href=#>are.na</a></li><li><a href="#">Instagram</a></li></ul>"`
- Add an image
- Link to another page (ex. about.htm)

## Push to Github
- [Github Deployment](Tutorials/Github%20Deployment.md)
	- While it's uploading take a stretch break! Stretch your wrists!

## Work on your HTML
As much as you can with pure HTML. The more content you put now, the more you'll have to work with in Week 2. Add as much visual hierarchy as you can with pure HTML. More tips in Required Reading below.

Take a look at my the [HTML demo page](https://github.com/meewgumi/Coding-For-Designers/blob/main/Code%20Demos/Week%201%20-%20HTML/html.htm) under Code Demos for ideas.

For the rest of class, work on populating your site with content.

**Element Ideas**
- `blockquote`, `cite`, `small`
- `ul`, `ol`, `li`
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` with `img`
- `hr` - horizontal rule

**Tips:**
- Think about `index` as an archival endeavor.
- What information are you archiving on your site? Is it an index of your class projects? Your web inspiration? A list of things you want to learn or create?
- Is it a list of your friends' websites? Books you've read this year or plan to read?
- Is it a log of what you did each week in class? (This is a great way to retain information!)
- Leave space for things you haven't made yet. For example, "What I learned in Week 2—_coming soon_"

## Link to another page
- Add images!
- Imagine this is a garden
- Put images or gifs of flowers, seeds, etc.
- Add a favicon
