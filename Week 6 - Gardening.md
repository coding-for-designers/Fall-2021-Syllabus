# Week 6 - Polishing
Add final flair, including transitions and animations. Share the final project—a completely handmade website.

# Food for Thought
_How can our design practice be improved by becoming a double threat—a designer who can also code?_ How will what you’ve learned so far change the way you approach designs or web mockups? What is the most surprising thing you learned?

# Workshop
## Device Testing
Let's look at each other's websites, take screenshots, and see how they look on different operating systems and browsers. Refer to the class site list on the [README](README.md) page.

What we learned during this demo: If your site is written in [Semantic HTML](Tutorials/Semantic%20Elements%20Review.md) with [relative units](Tutorials/Pixel%20Perfect%20doesn't%20exist%20on%20the%20web.md), it will be readable on old or low-cost devices. These devices typically strip Javascript from a page and will display some or all CSS styling. By defining your page and font sizing with relative and fluid CSS units, you can **design for screens you cannot see**.

### Workshop Artifacts
These are images and videos shared during the device testing workshop:

>Back in 1993, you weren't a designer, developer, copywriter or in devops. You were a fucking webmaster, and your name was at the bottom of every page.
>
>If you had a question, you emailed [webmaster@tomstrucking.net](mailto:webmaster@tomstrucking.net).
And that address got a lot of emails:
>-   "Please play the Star Trek theme when people get to my site."  
>-   "Can you put a hit counter on my web page?"  
>-   "I want my headline to be blinking."
>
>Folks treated webmasters like goddamned magicians. Just email us with your cyberspace dreams, and we'll make them a reality.
