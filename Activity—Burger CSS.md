# Burger CSS Activity
## Goal
Without deleting any CSS, use what you've learned about specificity and the cascade to override the site styles.

Using `style.css`, a blank file, you'll write in CSS that will override the styles contained in `main.css`. Experimenting with elements, IDs, classes, and nested elements will help you understand how conflicting CSS rules are resolved.

## Instructions
1. Download the [Burger Boilerplate Solution](https://github.com/coding-for-designers/burger-boilerplate-solution) files
2. Open Burger Boilerplate folder in Atom
3. Open `index.htm` in your web browser
4. Using the web inspector, search for elements you'd like to change
5. Add your custom code to `style.css`

Note: In the HTML file, `style.css` is declared **after** `main.css`, meaning that the styles you add to style.css should reset the styles in main.css.
