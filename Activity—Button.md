What is a "button" ? Think of the metaphor of a button as you create an interactive or animated page with a clickable button.

Your button can be `button` or `a`, and it doesn't need to go anywhere, but it needs at least two "states":
- Base (default) state
- Secondary state that appears with either: hover, click, or time delay animation

- You may include more than two states
