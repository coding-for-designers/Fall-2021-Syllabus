 ## Objective
 1. Learn how to create graphic elements with pure HTML & CSS.
 2. Use the Inspector as a design tool to position your shapes.
 3. By using relative units, your shapes should also be responsive!

## Techniques
- Create empty `<div>` elements with unique classes and IDs
- Apply `width:` and `height:` in `rem` or `%` to create the shape
- Add a [background](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) to fill in your div shape 
-   Create Circles with `border-radius: 50%`
-   Squares have equal width and height
-   Use `margin` to position your objects
-   Add a `border`
-   Rotate, skew, and scale with [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)
-   Play with [position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)
-   Layer elements with [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)
