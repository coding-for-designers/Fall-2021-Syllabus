# Theory
The page is full of layers that can move independently of one another. CSS can do animations, rotations, and more!

- Fluid Layout Theory
	- Designing for screens you can't see
	- Basic HTML and CSS will always render on any device
	- Fluidity is better than responsivity
	- History of fluid design
- Browser Compatibility Checker
	- Devices from watch to TV and everything in between
- Grid Layouts
- Media Queries
- `@supports`
	- For variable fonts and experimental features
	- Dark mode
- Inspector on Chrome, Safari, etc.
- Device emulators
- The Algorithm, chronological feeds, how web as garden subverts these ideals
