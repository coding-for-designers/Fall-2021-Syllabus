# Project 1
## Publishing Your Site
By our next class meeting, please complete as many of these tasks as you can. Only Level 1 (the in-class activity) and Level 2 are required. I highly suggest completing all of the levels so you can get a feel for and decide on your favorite web server to work with moving forward.

Goal: Understand how to publish an HTML page to a web server.
Tip: If you use `<img>`, you must also upload the images to the server so that other people can see them!

### Level 1
Local machine, Atom
Finish activity from [Activity—Local Website](Activity—Local%20Website.md)
Post screenshot to Slack

### Level 2
*Neocities is a revitalization of popular 00's webhost "Geocities". By creating a free account, you will be issued a subdomain (subdomain.neocities.org) as a web URL you can share with the public. Your content is hosted on Neocities' servers, which support HTML, CSS, and Javascript.*
1. Create a free account on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/)
2. Use their HTML Editor to publish `index.htm`
3. Share a screenshot with the class!
4. Share your Neocities URL

### Level 3
*Netlify supports HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby.*
1. Create a Github account if you haven't already

3. Create a free [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) account
4. On Netlify, create a new [Netlify site from Git](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/repo-permissions-linking/) and select Github as your provider.
6. Allow Netlify to access the Github repository you created in Step 2
7. On Github, verify that the Netlify app is installed properly (see image below)
8. Upload `index.htm` to your Github repository using any of these methods:
	1. On github.com, click `Add File > Create New File` and type your HTML manually in the browser
	2. On github.com, click `Add File > Upload Files` and upload an HTML document from your computer
	3. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and use it to auto-sync HTML files from a folder on your computer as you work on them through Atom (or other code editor)
9. Visit your Netlify dashboard to make sure your Github repository is deployed
10. Visit your Netlify URL and you should see `index.htm` !

3. Click `Settings > Github Pages` to make sure Github Pages is working
	1. If it's not, read my [instructions for Github Pages](https://github.com/coding-for-designers/ICD-Course-Reader/blob/main/Tutorials/Github%20Deployment.md) for the most common errors and how to fix them

5. Your site should be available on **username.github.io** !
11. Share a screenshot with the class!
12. Share your Github Pages URL

#### Github Pages Bonus
*Custom Domain Name*
[Instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

### Level 5
By buying your own webhosting plan, your bandwidth will not be throttled. This is recommended for your personal website if you want to have good uptime, want to upload lots of photos, or you anticipate growing your site to several thousand pageviews per month. Or if you just want to run on a green web host, since none of the free options are 100% renewable!

This is the only option that costs money for hosting. Custom domain names will always cost money as a separate fee and can be through a different company than your webhost (aka server) company. Most Shared hosting plans support HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL.

I like using [Krystal UK](https://affiliate.k.io/go/QTbUFQzLFL)[^1] because it runs on 100% renewable energy (hydro, wind, solar). I use [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (free FTP software) to upload files to the server. For domain registration, I usually use Dreamhost because they have super low prices and run on partially renewable energy.

### Pick your favorite!
If you made it all the way to the end, you've gotten a great introduction to the different webserver options that exist today. You may have already gotten a feel for which interface or workflow you prefer, but if not, no worries! I often choose a server based on the tech stack and what sort of software I'd like to run on the server. Throughout this class, we will only be using HTML and CSS, so any of these options will work great for your personal site!

**Tips:**
- Think about `index` as an archival endeavor.
- What information are you archiving on your site? Is it an index of your class projects? Your web inspiration? A list of things you want to learn or create?
- Is it a list of your friends' websites? Books you've read this year or plan to read?
- Is it a log of what you did each week in class? (This is a great way to retain information!)
- Leave space for things you haven't made yet. For example, "What I learned in Week 2—_coming soon_"
