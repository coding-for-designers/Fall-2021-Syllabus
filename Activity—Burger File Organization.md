### Clues & Hints
1. You do not need to edit any code in Atom
	1. You can also open the code in your browser by clicking Tools > Web Developer > Page Source
2. You can achieve the goals by simply moving files from `puzzle-pieces` to the other folders
3. You only need to move the files in `puzzle-pieces`

**So, why open Atom?**
There are clues inside the code!
