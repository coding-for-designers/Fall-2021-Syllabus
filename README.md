# Final Project
By the end of this course, your website should be at least a seedling 🌱. You can accomplish seedling activities during class workshops, but for anything more than that, you'll need to devote time to your coding education outside of class. I recommend 2-3 hours a week of independent study and coding work to get to 🏝 level.

## Assessment
🌱 Publish a single column site with images, text, and links styled with basic CSS

🌿 Publish a multi-column layout with intermediate CSS techniques

🌴 Use advanced CSS techniques and responsive/fluid design

🏝 Add CSS or JS animation, effects, or interactive elements
