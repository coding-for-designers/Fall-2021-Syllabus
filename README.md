# Intro to Coding for Designers
**Fall 2021** at [index-space](https://index-space.org/products/intro-to-coding-for-designers-1)

**Class:** Tuesdays 4–7pm EST

**Instructor:** <a href="[https://megumi.co](https://megumi.co/)">Megumi Tanaka</a>(they/them) is a designer and educator from the Bay Area. [Email](mailto:hello@megumi.co) with any questions.

**Learning Outcome:** Students will learn foundational web development and gain the ability to code static webpages from scratch. Students will learn to create fluid websites that are responsive by default.

---

# Final Project
By the end of this course, your website should be at least a seedling 🌱. You can accomplish seedling activities during class workshops, but for anything more than that, you'll need to devote time to your coding education outside of class. I recommend 2-3 hours a week of independent study and coding work to get to 🏝 level.

**Assessment**
🌱 Publish a single column site with images, text, and links styled with basic CSS
🌿 Publish a multi-column layout with intermediate CSS techniques
🌴 Use advanced CSS techniques and responsive/fluid design
🏝 Add CSS or JS animation, effects, or interactive elements
