  <p>This is a paragraph with text. Some of it is <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, or <u>underlined</u>. This page has no stylesheet, so all the sizes and spacing are determined by your browser.</p>
  <p>Headings go all the way to Heading 6. I have not defined their sizes in the stylesheet. These are the default ratios determined by your browser.</p>
  <p>Take note of the default padding between elements. This is the default design of your browser.</p>
  <p>This is a <a href="#">link that goes nowhere</a>. More specifically, it is an anchor link that goes to the top of the page. When you click it, the link state changes to :visited, and your browser turns it purple by default. Coming up is a
    horizontal rule (hr)</p>

      <figcaption>Caption! The figure element is new in HTML and it isn't required to display images, but it does make styling of images and captions easier when used with figcaption. Notice how img and figcaption are nested within figure.

    <div>The div element has no special meaning at all. It was once used to create multi-column layouts, back in the early 2000s when no other options existed in CSS. Authors are strongly encouraged to view the div element as an element of last
      resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the div element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.</div>

  <small>Small print typically features disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights. Small print is also sometimes used for attribution, or for satisfying licensing requirements. The small element should not be used for extended spans of
    text, such as multiple paragraphs, lists, or sections of text. It is only intended for short runs of text. The text of a page listing terms of use, for instance, would not be a suitable candidate for the small element: in such a case, the text is
    not a side comment, it is the main content of the page.</small>
